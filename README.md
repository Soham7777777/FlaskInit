## Purpose of this project:
---

- To provide a minimal template with just enough file structure and code to get started with any flask project.

- This project takes sqlalchemy as minimial requirement since sqlachemy is **not only ORM but also allows to write raw query for supported databases**.

- Note that this project don't include packages like flask-wtforms, flask-login, pydantic, flask-restful ect... The reason is that this project should only provide minimal requirements.


## Some Important steps before using this template:
---

- Remove comment for instance directory in `.gitignore` file.
